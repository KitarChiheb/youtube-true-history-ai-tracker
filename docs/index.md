# YT True History – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 26 Feb 2026_

## Data we store
- YouTube video title, channel, thumbnail URL, watch percent, watch time, timestamp, autoplay flag, and AI category labels.
- User settings (watch thresholds, autoplay/hidden tab preferences, OpenRouter AI toggle/key).
- Weekly AI report summaries.

Everything is saved **locally** via `chrome.storage.local` inside your browser; we never run a backend service or sync to external servers.

## How data is used
- To show your intentional watch history, filters, and stats in the popup/dashboard.
- To run optional AI categorization and weekly reports if you supply an OpenRouter API key. Requests go **directly** from your browser to `https://openrouter.ai/` using your key; no proxy or third-party logging occurs.

## Data sharing
We do **not** sell, rent, or transfer your data to anyone. The only time data leaves your device is:
1. When you click “Export” (JSON/CSV) and choose where to save it.
2. When you opt into AI features and send metadata to OpenRouter’s API.

## Your choices
- Toggle tracking or AI features anytime from the popup or dashboard.
- Clear all stored history/settings via the dashboard’s “Clear all data” button or by uninstalling the extension.
- Export/import history for personal backups.
